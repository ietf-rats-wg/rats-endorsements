Having trouble with cloning and building, so no PR yet, but wanted to share before the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RATS verifier receives evidence from an attester that must be considered untrusted until established otherwise. This trust is established using cryptography. Typically, the attester will sign a nonce with a private key it possesses and the verifier will verify it with a public key it possesses. While this is typical, cryptography other than public key may also be used.\r\n\r\nSince it is not possible to establish trust in an attester without cryptography, the verifier must have a verification key for each attester.  The verification key comes to the verifier in an endorsement from an endorser.\r\n\r\nNo particularly algorithm or cryptographic protocol is assumed for the verification of the attester. The verification key could be a symmetric key, a public key or something more sophisticated. Thus there is no assumption about the type of verification key in the endorsement.\r\n\r\n(In theory the verification key could also come in reference values or appraisal policy, the other inputs to the verifier, but that would not line up with the descriptions in the RATS architecture).\r\n",

If the words are taken in isolation, they can be misinterpreted. If we are relying on the figure (and not the words) to tell the complete story, then the I-D inconsistently applies this philosophy because in figure 2 we said the figure wasn't confusing if you read the text in isolation. \r\n\r\nThe principle that should be explained, IMHO, is that conditional endorsement uses a matching condition to identify whether or not the endorsement claims to be added are relevant to an ACS (appraised claim set). Since the ACS contains only actual state, the condition is expressed in a way that expects to match only actual state (and not in a way that would match possible / reference state). Saying that \"state matches Reference Values\" leaves a lot up to the imagination of the reader to figure out how this works. ",

      "body": "I find section 4 difficult to read. The heading \"Endorsing Evidence Provenance\" is not an intuitive concept. The authors must explain what it means first. \r\n\r\nThe first paragraph seems to describe that Evidence should be authenticated. This could be stated more plainly. \r\n\r\nThe second paragraph seems to make the same statement, but in a contra indicated way. There is a DICE example in Section 2, that could be referenced as it seems to describe layering. But it isn't clear how paragraph 2 (section 4) pertains to \"provenance\" or \"endorsement\". \r\n\r\nFor example: \"Such a certificate need not be stored by the Verifier when the Endorsement can be resolved on demand or passed to the Verifier along with the Evidence\"\r\nThe concept of \"Endorsement resolution\" is not described in the I-D. The reader is assumed to know what this entails. It's relevance to \"provenance\" is not obvious.\r\n\u00a0\r\nI believe the first sentence of the 3rd paragraph is actually incorrect:\r\n\"No particular algorithm or cryptographic protocol is assumed for the verification of the Attester.\"\r\nA verifier must implement the algorithm/protocol that authenticates the Attester / AE otherwise the integrity of the evidence is suspect. \r\n\r\n\"Evidence typically contains an identifier for the Attester (e.g., [[I-D.ietf-rats-eat](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rats-endorsements-01.html#I-D.ietf-rats-eat)] ueid) in a claim, sometimes termed an \"identity claim\", that can be used by the Verifier to look up its verification key for the Attester.\"\r\nThe 4th paragraph is not typical as Evidence often describes a class of devices rather than a specific instance of a device. \r\nInstead, it is typical for a lead Attester to have authentication credentials that identifies an instance of a device. However, this is also is contradicted by I-D:daa-attestation where a group key maintains the class nature of evidence while also authenticating the evidence. \r\n\r\nThe fifth paragraph seems to take a circumlocutions approach to saying that Evidence must be authenticated (restating what the first paragraph is saying) and that Evidence authentication should be the first step before applying other appraisal steps. Maybe this could be said more directly?\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph seems to be summarizing the steps that a verifier might follow, but seems out of place in a section on evidence provenance. \r\n\r\nIt is still unclear to me if the goal of the section is to assert that Evidence provenance means Evidence should be authenticated, if this is giving general (cherry picked) advice to verifiers, or if this is aimed at Endorsers who may need to do something (???) in order to ensure Endorsements have \"provenance\" (e.g., sign endorsement claims?).\r\n\r\nMaybe a different approach would be to explain that AE's have attestation keys that authenticate evidence and that provenance of attestation keys is needed to build trust in the AEs? This is what the PKIX  Consortium refers to as \"key attestation\". Maybe the authors are saying that AEs' attestation keys should be backed by key attestation?\r\n",

It says:\r\n\r\n\"Thus each Target Environment (application, OS, firmware, and hardware) has **one set** of claims in the Evidence, and an **additional set** of claims in the Endorsement from its manufacturer. A Verifier that trusts each Endorser would thus use **claims from both** conceptual messages when comparing against reference state for a given Target Environment.\"\r\n\r\nI'm hesitant to use a very different term in the diagram since the now-approved EAT spec uses \"claims set\" for the set of claims in Evidence.  We should, however, match that and use \"claims set\" instead of \"claimset\".  (RFC 9334 uses \"Claim set\", so perhaps that would be better, but neither document uses \"claimset\" as one word now.)\r\n\r\n> Section 5 states: \"The binding between Target Environment and Endorser might be part of the Appraisal Policy for Evidence\" This seems incorrect as the binding between Endorsements claims and Evidence claims is based on the matching condition found in the Endorsement claims.\r\n\r\nIt is not incorrect.  Basing the binding solely on a matching condition found in Endorsement claims would be a security vulnerability, as it would allow an Endorser to simply include claims about any other Target Environment in the Attester, rather than just the permitted one(s).  In a secure system, Appraisal Policy must be able to control which Endorsers are believed for claims about which Target Environment and not just allow a free-for-all.\r\n\r\n> I'm confused by \"or might be specified as part of the Evidence itself, or some combination of the two\" because it isn't clear what the connection is between Evidence and Appraisal policy for Evidence that defines a binding between a TE and an Endorser. Use of the term \"binding\" seems overloaded with other uses within the same document. Wouldn't the TE be identified by its class / instance name? Wouldn't the Endorser and Attester developers have to agree on these names?\r\n\r\nAs an example, claims from a Target Environment itself might contain a secure identifier of the Endorser that can provide additional claims about that Target Environment.  I can add that example for clarity.\r\n\r\n",

The \"same\" means \"across many clients\", not that a RVP and an Endorser provide the same information.  Will reword to be clearer.\r\n\r\n> This line: \"clients ... are generally on devices that are not constrained nodes\" is not commonly agreed upon as there are many cases of embedded verifiers, BMCs and so forth. \r\n\r\nThe above is a misquote.  The word \"and\" (missing from the above quote) is significant as \"clients\" is not the subject of the \"are generally\".  It says that _RVPs and Endorsers_ are generally on devices that are not constrained nodes.  You didn't mention any disagreement regarding those roles.  (I'm not sure what a BMC is.)\r\n\r\n[nms] BMC is Baseboard Management Controller\r\n\r\nRVPs and Endorsers are generally servers or services rather than \"devices\". The idea could be conveyed more succinctly by \"...Verifier), and are generally services on unconstrained nodes....\"\r\n\r\n> The conclusion that scalability of verifiers \"is not a significant concern\" to RATS is not true or that it is not \"typical\".\r\n\r\nThe text never says that scalability of verifiers is not a significant concern.  Indeed as you mention the second paragraph says it is, which I think we all agree on.\r\n\r\n> The following paragraph seems to reinforce my point.\r\n> \r\n> This may be writing style.

It seems you might have missed the word \"and\".\r\n\r\n[nms] Maybe. A one sentence paragraph with multiple parts is hard to parse.\r\n\r\n> The last two paragraphs seem more focused on complexity than scalability. Maybe they belong in section 6.1? BTW: If this is intended as a security considerations section it shouldn't be a subsection heading. Othewise, this section seems to be about complexity hence it's heading might be more reflective of this.\r\n\r\nCode space does affect scalability in terms of scale down to constrained nodes with limited space, so code complexity is one aspect of scalability.\r\n\r\n> Section 6 isn't so much about formats as it is about complexity and scalability.
